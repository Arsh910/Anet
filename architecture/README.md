# ANet — Architecture

Internals and design of ANet. For installation and day-to-day usage, see the
[main README](../README.md). For extending ANet, see the per-folder guides:
[ExTools](../anet_pack/ExTools/README.md) · [ExAgents](../anet_pack/ExAgents/README.md) ·
[mcps](../anet_pack/mcps/README.md) · [skills](../anet_pack/skills/README.md).

---

## Request lifecycle

ANet routes every request through a **planning layer** (the "manager") that
decides which agents run, in what order, and which can run in parallel. Each
agent has its own model, its own tools, and its own job.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    U(["You — natural-language request"]) --> M{"Manager · Planner"}
    M -->|"greeting / simple fact"| R(["Direct reply"])
    M -->|"real task"| P["Plan a DAG of steps"]
    P --> A1["research_agent"]
    P --> A2["code_agent"]
    P --> A3["computer_agent"]
    A1 --> C{"checker_agent"}
    A2 --> C
    A3 --> C
    C -->|"partial / failed"| P
    C -->|"success"| S["Synthesizer"]
    S --> O(["Final reply"])
    A2 -. spawn_tool .-> A1
```

- **Planner** — classifies the request as `simple` (direct reply) or a `plan`
  (a DAG of steps). Steps declare `depends_on` and `wait_for_async`.
- **Executor** — runs all *ready* steps concurrently (`asyncio.gather`);
  dependent steps wait for their predecessors.
- **Checker** — classifies each step's result as **success / partial / failure**
  and can return an *adjustment* that triggers a bounded retry.
- **Synthesizer** — streams the final answer from the combined step results.

## Component architecture

```mermaid

    subgraph CLI["CLI · main.py"]
        IN["Prompt + slash commands"]
    end
    subgraph ENG["Engine · engine.py"]
        PL["Planner"] --> EX["Executor"] --> CH["Checker"] --> SY["Synthesizer"]
    end
    subgraph RUN["Orchestrator + agent_runner"]
        LOOP["Agentic loop · cycle detection"]
    end

    IN --> PL
    SY --> IN

    LOOP --> TOOLS[("Built-in tools<br/>+ ExTools")]
    LOOP --> MCP[("MCP servers<br/>(from the active pack)")]
    ENG --> STORE[("conversations.db<br/>shared, keyed by thread")]
    RUN --> MEM[("mem0<br/>(Chroma + fastembed)")]
    RUN --> SK[("skills/<br/>learned procedures")]
```

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `anet/core/engine.py` | Planner → executor → checker → synthesizer pipeline (pure Python, no LangChain) |
| `anet/core/orchestrator.py` | The agentic loop for one agent: model ↔ tool-call iterations, cycle detection, confirmation gate, skill tracking |
| `anet/core/agent_runner.py` | One model call; provider dispatch (OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, Vertex) |
| `anet/core/store.py` | `aiosqlite` conversation store — one shared DB keyed by `thread` |
| `anet/core/memory_store.py` | Long-term memory backend — wraps mem0 (local Chroma + fastembed + your LLM) |
| `anet/core/skill_manager.py` | Self-improving skills — search, create, curate |
| `anet/core/mcp_loader.py` | MCP server lifecycle (launch, list tools, keep alive) |
| `anet/core/ex_loader.py` | Load ExTools/ExAgents from `exanet.config.yaml` |
| `anet/cli/banner.py` | Animated startup banner + README image export |

---

## Safety mechanisms

| Guard | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Confirmation gate** | `shell_tool` (every command), `edit_tool` (every edit), and destructive `file_tool` actions pause for explicit `y` / `n` / `a` approval |
| **Per-agent step cap** | each agent has a `max_steps` limit (defaults: research 10, code 60, file 25, computer 20, checker 8) |
| **Cycle detection** | the same write operation repeated 3× in a sliding window stops the loop (reads are exempt) |
| **Spawn depth limit** | `spawn_tool` nesting is capped at 2 to prevent runaway delegation |

## Memory & learning loop

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    T["Conversation turns"] -->|"every 5 turns"| BG["mem0 fact extraction"]
    T -->|"every 10 turns"| NUDGE["Memory nudge to active agent"]
    EXIT(["Clean exit"]) --> FINAL["Final mem0 extraction pass"]
    BG --> M[("mem0 store<br/>Chroma + fastembed")]
    NUDGE --> M
    FINAL --> M
    M -->|"recalled next session"| PLAN["Planner already knows you"]
```

- **Short-term memory (rolling window)** — each turn the model is given a
  **token-budgeted** view of the conversation (`context_window.py`): a **rolling
  summary** of older turns plus as many recent turns as fit `context.recent_tokens`
  (default 3000), with the last `min_recent` always kept verbatim. When turns
  overflow the budget the summary is updated automatically (one LLM call, only
  then) and persisted per-thread in the store, so it survives `/session` switches
  and `--resume`. This replaced the old fixed "last-8-messages" slice, so the
  planner now retains the whole session, not just the tail. `/forget` and
  `/compress` remain as manual overrides.
- **Long-term memory (mem0)** — every `incremental_interval` turns (default 5),
  and once more on clean exit, the recent conversation is handed to **mem0**, which
  uses your configured LLM to extract the salient facts and de-duplicate them
  against what it already knows (steered by `memory.instructions` in the pack
  config). Storage is fully local: a **Chroma** vector DB under `~/.anet/memory/`
  with **fastembed** (on-device) embeddings — no server, no hosted service. The
  manager recalls relevant memories on the next session, and `/profile` shows
  everything stored.
- **Memory classification (no hardcoded tags)** — when a memory is saved explicitly,
  the LLM classifies it into a **category defined in `memory.categories`** (config,
  not code) and decides which agents it `applies_to`. Categories marked
  `always_inject: true` (e.g. `preference`, `identity`) reach their agents on every
  task — even when they share no keywords with the request — which is how a standing
  style rule like "prefix functions `anet_`" actually gets applied. Everything else
  is retrieved by relevance. No magic `preference`/`code_agent` tags for the model to
  remember; the classification and scoping are decided by the model, against
  editable config.
- **Memory nudge** — every `nudge_interval` turns (default 10), the active agent
  is prompted to persist genuinely new facts via `memory_tool` (which writes to the
  same mem0 store).
- **Context compression** — past ~40 messages, ANet offers **[f] forget**
  (keep last 20) or **[c] compress** (summarise). Also `/forget`, `/compress`.
- **Self-improving skills** — see [skills/README.md](../anet_pack/skills/README.md).

---

## Sessions & persistence

All sessions share a single `conversations.db`, keyed by a `thread` column. This
makes `/session <name>` switching instant and lossless — switching is a string
change, not a database reconnect. Each session also keeps a small folder for
metadata (e.g. `title.txt`).

```text
<anet-home>/                 # e.g. ~/.anet  (or ANET_HOME)
├── memory/                  # long-term memory (mem0): Chroma DB + history.db
└── sessions/
    ├── conversations.db     # one shared store for ALL sessions, keyed by thread
    └── <session_id>/        # per-session folder — metadata only (title.txt)
```

> Legacy per-session `checkpoint.db` files (from older versions) are folded into
> the shared store automatically on first run.

---

## The Smiths — assisted integration

ANet ships three standalone agents (never seen by the planner) that scaffold,
**validate**, and **wire up** integrations for you.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    P["/newtool &lt;path&gt;"] --> E["Explore the source"]
    E --> Q["Confirm name + capability with you"]
    Q --> W["Write ExTools/&lt;name&gt;/__init__.py"]
    W --> V{"extool_validator"}
    V -->|"fix &amp; retry"| W
    V -->|"PASS"| REG["registrar: register + attach to chosen agents"]
    REG --> CFG[("exanet.config.yaml")]
```

| Smith | Command | Validates with | Then |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ToolSmith** | `/newtool <path>` | `extool_validator` | registers the ExTool, attaches it to agents you pick |
| **MCPSmith** | `/addmcp <path>` | `mcp_doctor` | attaches the server to agents you pick |
| **AgentSmith** | `/newagent <desc>` | — | writes the prompt + registers the agent with your chosen tools/MCP |
| **PackSmith** | `/packsmith new` / `share` / `add` | `pack_tool` | scaffolds a blank pack / bundles a pack to a zip (secrets stripped) / installs a received zip |

### The `registrar` tool — the safety boundary

All smith config changes go through one built-in tool, `registrar`
(`anet/AnetTools/registrar/`). It **only ever writes `exanet.config.yaml`** — it
is structurally incapable of touching `anet.config.yaml` or the core `anet/`
package. Attaching a tool/MCP to a **built-in** agent is recorded in an `attach:`
section of `exanet.config.yaml`, which the loader merges at startup — so built-in
agents gain capabilities without any edit to `anet.config.yaml`.

| `registrar` action | Effect |
|---|---|
| `list_agents` / `list_tools` / `list_mcps` | Discovery — what's available to attach (drives the multi-select) |
| `register_tool` | Add a `tools:` entry to `exanet.config.yaml` |
| `register_agent` | Add an `agents:` entry to `exanet.config.yaml` |
| `attach` | Add (never remove) tools/MCP to chosen agents (external → their block; built-in → `attach:`) |

**Who can attach to built-in agents:** extending a core (built-in) agent is limited
to the **ToolSmith and MCPSmith** — the registrar checks the calling agent's name
(injected as `_agent_name`) and refuses a built-in attach from anyone else
(e.g. the AgentSmith). External ExAgents have no such limit.

Details: [ExTools](../anet_pack/ExTools/README.md) · [ExAgents](../anet_pack/ExAgents/README.md) · [mcps](../anet_pack/mcps/README.md).

## Packs & the active workspace

A **pack** is a self-contained workspace folder (config + ExTools/ExAgents/mcps/
skills + SOUL.md). Which pack is "live" is resolved by `paths.workspace_root()`:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    R["workspace_root()"] --> A{"active_pack.txt"}
    A -->|"'anet_pack' (default)"| D{"source checkout?"}
    D -->|"yes (dev)"| RP["&lt;repo&gt;/anet_pack/"]
    D -->|"no (installed)"| HP["&lt;home&gt;/anet_pack/"]
    A -->|"a named pack"| SP["&lt;home&gt;/yourpacks/&lt;name&gt;/<br/>or shared_packs/&lt;name&gt;/"]
```

- Packs you **create** (`/packsmith new`) live in `<home>/yourpacks/<name>/`; packs you
  **receive** (`/packsmith add`) live in `<home>/shared_packs/<name>/`. Resolving a named
  active pack searches `yourpacks/` then `shared_packs/`.
- **`<home>/active_pack.txt`** holds the selected pack name (default `anet_pack`).
- `/changepack` writes that pointer, calls `config_loader.reset_cache()`, and sets a
  reload flag so the main loop rebuilds the engine against the new pack before the
  next turn. Every loader reads `workspace_root()`, so the switch is global.
- **Sharing** (`anet/AnetTools/pack_tool/`): `export` copies a pack → zip with all
  `.env`/secrets and heavy junk stripped + an embedded README; `import_pack`
  extracts into `shared_packs/<name>`; both are pure file ops — **pack code is never
  executed**. The PackSmith agent adds the judgment (README writing, secret
  collection, README-documented setup via the approval-gated `shell_tool`).
- First-run **seeding** always targets the *default* pack (`default_pack_root()`), so
  switching the active pack never affects what gets seeded.
